# What is a Data Structure?

A data structure (DS) is a way of organizating data so that it can be used effectively.

## Basics before learning DS

Some of the basics are:

1. Pointers
2. Classes
3. Recursion
4. Dynamic Programming
5. Memory Allocation

## Start with BIG-O notation

- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity

After taking a look at above things, now you can start learning Data Structures.

1. Arrays
2. Lists
   - Singly Linked List
   - Doubly Linked List
   - Circular Linked List
3. Stacks
4. Queues
5. Hash Tables
6. Trees
7. Heaps
8. Graphs

There are sub-domains of above topics, so make sure to get along with every topic so that It can make your DS knowledge more strong in-depth.
